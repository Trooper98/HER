				<li>The first <b>three</b> weeks you should only eat solids. Taking adequate amounts of fluid after surgery is essential as it helps your body to heal</li>
				<li><b>After three weeks</b> you can commence a non-chew food diet i.e food you can squish between your fingers and anything that doesn't make noise.</li>
				<li><b>After six weeks</b> you can progress to a soft chew diet. Portions should be small and in pieces to avoid putting pressure on the jaw.</li>
				<li>After <b>six to eight weeks</b>, you can progress to more normal chewing. Continue to avoid overly hard foods.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>The amount of swelling is going to make it harder to brush your teeth. <b>Do not</b> brush your teeth for one full week after surgery.</li>
				<li>Use warm saline rinses (1/2 teaspoon salt in a tumbler of warm water). Rinse as often as you would like. This will keep your mouth nice and clean and will also tend to shrink the incision lines inside the mouth.</li>
				<li>Swelling begins to lessen after about one week. Purchase a new baby toothbrush, and using a small amount of toothpaste, concentrate on brushing the metal braces. Clean the braces gently but thoroughly.</li>
				<li>Avoid showering for two days after surgery, although taking a bath is fine provided you do not get the facial incisions wet.</li>
